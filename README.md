# subnetting-lab 2
 
 About this project:
Hello! Thanks for reading this. My name is Erik. This is the second subnetting lab I created. I used it to help myself learn React. It is a bit of a continuation of my previous subnetting lab

 What it does:
The purpose of this project is to present a webpage that a user can use to practice their CIDR notation. It can randomly generate a new question as well. This one is an upgrade on my previous lab in that it can generate multiple groups and will check them all. This project is designed to help people trying to get ready for certification exams such as the CompTIA Network+ and CCNA.
